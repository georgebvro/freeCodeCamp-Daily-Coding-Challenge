Given an integer, determine if it is a perfect square.

* A number is a perfect square if you can multiply an integer by itself to achieve the number. For example, 9 is a perfect square because you can multiply 3 by itself to get it.

### Tests

1. `isPerfectSquare(9)` should return `true`.
2. `isPerfectSquare(49)` should return `true`.
3. `isPerfectSquare(1)` should return `true`.
4. `isPerfectSquare(2)` should return `false`.
5. `isPerfectSquare(99)` should return `false`.
6. `isPerfectSquare(-9)` should return `false`.
7. `isPerfectSquare(0)` should return `true`.
8. `isPerfectSquare(25281)` should return `true`.
