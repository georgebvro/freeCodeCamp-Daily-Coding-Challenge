## Open Issues

Given an array of issue numbers and another array of pull request (PR) numbers, return an array of issues that remain open after all PRs have been merged.

* A PR closes an issue if their digits are a rotation of each other. For example, issue 123 would be closed by PR 231 or 312.
* A PR does not close an issue with the exact same number. For example, PR 123 does not close issue 123. So an issue with all the same number can't get closed.
* Either number may have leading zeros stripped. For example, PR 201 would close issue 12 (012, a rotation of 201). Similarily, issue 201 would be closed by PR 12.

Return the remaining open issues in the order they were given.

### Tests:

1. `getOpenIssues([123, 234], [231])` should return `[234]`.
2. `getOpenIssues([123, 345, 16], [345, 231])` should return `[345, 16]`.
3. `getOpenIssues([456, 332, 12, 15], [201, 945, 180])` should return `[456, 332, 15]`.
4. `getOpenIssues([12, 115, 296, 170, 24], [17, 18, 19, 20, 21])` should return `[115, 296, 24]`.
5. `getOpenIssues([19, 95, 422, 395, 754, 102, 296, 709, 237, 4400, 1802], [395, 440, 9001, 95, 242, 21, 287, 169, 14])` should return `[95, 395, 754, 296, 709, 237, 1802]`.
