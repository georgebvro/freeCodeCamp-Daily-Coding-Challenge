## BuzzFizz

Given an array, determine if it is a correct FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to the last item in the array. A sequence is correct if:
* Numbers that are multiples of 3 are replaced with "Fizz"
* Numbers that are multiples of 5 are replaced with "Buzz"
* Numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 are replaced with "FizzBuzz"
* All other numbers remain as integers in ascending order, starting from 1.
* The array must start at 1 and have no missing or extra elements.

### Tests

1. `isFizzBuzz([1, 2, "Fizz", 4])` should return `true`.
2. `isFizzBuzz([1, 2, 3, 4])` should return `false`.
3. `isFizzBuzz([1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", 7])` should return `false`.
4. `isFizzBuzz([1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", 7, 8, "Fizz", "Buzz", 11, "Fizz", 13, "FizzBuzz"])` should return `false`.
5. `isFizzBuzz([1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", 7, 8, "Fizz", "Buzz", 11, "Fizz", 13, "Fizz"])` should return `false`.
6. `isFizzBuzz([1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", 7, 8, "Fizz", "Buzz", 11, "Fizz", 13, "Buzz"])` should return `false`.
7. `isFizzBuzz([1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", 7, 8, "Fizz", "Buzz", 11, "Fizz", 13, 14, "FizzBuzz", 16, 17, "Fizz", 19, "Buzz", "Fizz", 22, 23, "Fizz", "Buzz", 26, "Fizz", 28, 29, "FizzBuzz", 31, 32, "Fizz", 34, "Buzz", "Fizz", 37, 38, "Fizz", "Buzz", 41, "Fizz", 43, 44, "FizzBuzz", 46, 47, "Fizz", 49, "Buzz"])` should return `true`.
