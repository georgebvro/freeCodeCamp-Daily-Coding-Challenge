## Nth Prime

A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself. The first five prime numbers are `2`, `3`, `5`, `7`, and `11`.

Given a positive integer `n`, return the `n`th prime number. For example, given `5` return the 5th prime number: `11`.

### Tests

1. `nthPrime(5)` should return `11`.
2. `nthPrime(10)` should return `29`.
3. `nthPrime(16)` should return `53`.
4. `nthPrime(99)` should return `523`.
5. `nthPrime(1000)` should return `7919`.
