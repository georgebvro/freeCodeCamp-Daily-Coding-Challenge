## Space Week Day 3: Phone Home

For day three of Space Week, you are given an array of numbers representing distances (in kilometers) between yourself, satellites, and your home planet in a communication route. Determine how long it will take a message sent through the route to reach its destination planet using the following constraints:

* The first value in the array is the distance from your location to the first satellite.
* Each subsequent value, except for the last, is the distance to the next satellite.
* The last value in the array is the distance from the previous satellite to your home planet.
* The message travels at 300,000 km/s.
* Each satellite the message passes through adds a 0.5 second transmission delay.
* Return a number rounded to 4 decimal places, with trailing zeros removed.

### Tests

1. `sendMessage([300000, 300000])` should return `2.5`.
2. `sendMessage([384400, 384400])` should return `3.0627`.
3. `sendMessage([54600000, 54600000])` should return `364.5`.
4. `sendMessage([1000000, 500000000, 1000000])` should return `1674.3333`.
5. `sendMessage([10000, 21339, 50000, 31243, 10000])` should return `2.4086`.
6. `sendMessage([802101, 725994, 112808, 3625770, 481239])` should return `21.1597`.
