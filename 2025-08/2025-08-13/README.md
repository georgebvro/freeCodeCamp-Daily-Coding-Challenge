## Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. When starting with `0` and `1`, the first 10 numbers in the sequence are `0`, `1`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `5`, `8`, `13`, `21`, `34`.

Given an array containing the first two numbers of a Fibonacci sequence, and an integer representing the length of the sequence, return an array containing the sequence of the given length.

* Your function should handle sequences of any length greater than or equal to zero.
* If the length is zero, return an empty array.
* Note that the starting numbers are part of the sequence.

### Tests

1. `fibonacciSequence([0, 1], 20)` should return `[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181]`.
2. `fibonacciSequence([21, 32], 1)` should return `[21]`.
3. `fibonacciSequence([0, 1], 0)` should return `[]`.
4. `fibonacciSequence([10, 20], 2)` should return `[10, 20]`.
5. `fibonacciSequence([123456789, 987654321], 5)` should return `[123456789, 987654321, 1111111110, 2098765431, 3209876541]`.
