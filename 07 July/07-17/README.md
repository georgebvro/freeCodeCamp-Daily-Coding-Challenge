## Birthday Countdown

Given today's date and a birthday, return the number of days until the person's next birthday.

* Today's date is given as a string in `"YYYY-MM-DD"` format, with leading zeros, for example: `"2026-07-16"`.
* The birthday is given as a string in `"M/D"` format, without leading zeros, for example: `"9/7"`.
* If today is their birthday, return the number of days until their next birthday (not `0`).
* Leap years should be accounted for.

### Tests:

1. `daysUntilBirthday("2026-07-16", "9/7")` should return `53`.
2. `daysUntilBirthday("2026-07-16", "3/22")` should return `249`.
3. `daysUntilBirthday("2026-07-16", "7/16")` should return `365`.
4. `daysUntilBirthday("2024-02-28", "3/1")` should return `2`.
5. `daysUntilBirthday("2023-04-24", "12/30")` should return `250`.
6. `daysUntilBirthday("2024-03-01", "2/29")` should return `1460`.
7. `daysUntilBirthday("2096-03-01", "2/29")` should return `2920`.
