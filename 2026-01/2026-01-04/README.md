A year is a leap year if it satisfies the following rules:
* The year is evenly divisible by 4, and
* The year is not evenly divisible by 100, unless
* The year is evenly divisible by 400.

### Tests

1. `isLeapYear(2024)` should return `true`.
2. `isLeapYear(2023)` should return `false`.
3. `isLeapYear(2100)` should return `false`.
4. `isLeapYear(2000)` should return `true`.
5. `isLeapYear(1999)` should return `false`.
6. `isLeapYear(2040)` should return `true`.
7. `isLeapYear(2026)` should return `false`.
