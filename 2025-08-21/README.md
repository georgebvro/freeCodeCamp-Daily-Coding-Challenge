## Mile Pace

Given a number of miles ran, and a time in "MM:SS" (minutes:seconds) it took to run those miles, return a string for the average time it took to run each mile in the format "MM:SS".

* Add leading zeros when needed.

### Tests
1. `milePace(3, "24:00")` should return `"08:00"`.
2. `milePace(1, "06:45")` should return `"06:45"`.
3. `milePace(2, "07:00")` should return `"03:30"`.
4. `milePace(26.2, "120:35")` should return `"04:36"`.
